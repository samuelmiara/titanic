# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project utilizes regression models, random forest, and neural networks to predict whether a Titanic passenger survived the disaster based on available features.

## Data
Data is from kaggle
The model is based on the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, such as:
- `Fare` – ticket price
- `Pclass` – passenger class (1, 2, 3)
- `Sex` – passenger's gender
- `Embarked` – port of embarkation

## Model
The models are used to predict the `Survived` value, which takes the following values:
- `0` – passenger did not survive
- `1` – passenger survived

## Results
If two models predict the same outcome, that result is chosen.
